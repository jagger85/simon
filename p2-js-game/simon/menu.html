              Dear user,
              I'm writing to invite you to try out a new memory pattern game. As you may know, our memory is an essential part of our cognitive abilities, and improving it can bring many benefits to our daily lives.
              The game consists of various levels of increasing difficulty, and it's aimed at enhancing memory and concentration. Each level presents a pattern of colors, and you'll need to memorize and reproduce it accurately to move on to the next one.
              It's a fun way to challenge yourself and improve your performance over time.<br/>
